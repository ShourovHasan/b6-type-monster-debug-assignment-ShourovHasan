                                                The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB. But the storage capacity of session storage is 5MB.

                                            <li>
                                                As local storage is not session-based, it must be deleted via JavaScript or manually. Session storage is session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed.
                                            </li>

                                                In JavaScript, the whole document is global scope, and all the other functions and variables are
                                                contained in this global scope. But Block Scope is a variable when declared inside the if or switch
                                                conditions or inside for or while loops and is accessible within that particular condition or loop.
                                                To be concise, the variables declared inside the curly
                                                braces are called within block scope.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                The global variables can be accessed by any line of code in the program, including inside blocks.
                                                But the variables that are declared within the block scope are comparable to local ones. They are
                                                available within the block that they are defined within.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Global variables are defined outside of any function or curly braces and have a global scope. The
                                                variables have a
                                                global scope, which implies that any function or condition within the program can access them.
                                                Another subclass of local
                                                scope is block scope. The scope of the variables enclosed by curly brackets is known as the block
                                                scope. These curly
                                                brackets might now represent loops, conditional expressions, or something else entirely. These
                                                variables may only be
                                                referred to from inside the curly brackets.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions or
                                                curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. ES6 introduced block scope by using the let and
                                                const keywords. These two keywords are
                                                scoped within the block in which they are defined.

                                                The event loop is a programming technique or design pattern used in computer science that allows
                                                programs to wait for and respond to events or messages. Making a request to an internal or external
                                                "event provider" (which typically delays the request until an event has occurred) initiates the
                                                event loop, which subsequently calls the appropriate event
                                                handler ("dispatches the event"). Other names for the event loop include message dispatcher, message
                                                loop, message pump, and run loop.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                If the event provider adheres to the file interface, which can be chosen or "polled" (the Unix
                                                system call, not actual polling), the event-loop may be used in conjunction with a reactor. Almost
                                                always, the event loop and the message originator run asynchronously.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                The event loop, a built-in mechanism that manages the execution of various sections of your program
                                                over time while periodically activating the JS Engine, is the common denominator across all
                                                contexts.
                                            </li>

                                                The event loop may be referred to as the main loop or the main event loop when it serves as the
                                                program's primary control flow structure, which it frequently does. This event loop is at the
                                                highest level of control within the program;
                                                therefore, the title is fitting.
